**Kiyoshi Miyazawa**  
  
- child of Kenji, Kyouka [Izumi], and Kyuusaku "Kyuu" [Yumeno] Miyazawa; biologically Kyouka and Kenji's  
	- the oldest of their family  
- nonbinary (mostly ID's as a demiboy, demigirl, and demigender simultaneously)  
	- he/him, she/her, they/them  
- pansexual  
- starts the series at 8 and ends at 15  
- born November 15th, 2006  
- **Namesake:** Kiyoshi Jinzai  
- *Ability:* Boy  
	- *Ability Details:* Though I'm not entirely sure of the full capabilities of this ability yet, the idea I have for it right now is that it's essentially a visual copy of Kiyoshi, but is autonomous, independent, and sapient; it can't speak verbally, but can communicate in a variety of other ways. It is also an incredibly physically powerful Ability, much more so than Kiyoshi himself, and appears to be more mature in personality and mental state.  
- **Affiliation:** first and foremost, the Apprentices of the Armed Detective Agency, and later on the ADA itself  
- **Level at which I think about them:** low; I love her it's just that her family isn't always on my mind  
- **Brief Notes:** A certified sweetheart, Kiyoshi is often described as being Kenji's shadow or mini-self, and it's really not hard to see why. Though they're a smart and kind kid, they're more than a little naive, so it's a good thing they have both a powerful family and a powerful Ability to protect them whenever they get in a little over their head. Most people like them anyway, though (it's part of the charm they inherited from Kenji), so they're usually fine on their own, so long as they don't manage to accidentally offend someone with their at-times odd or off-key manner of speaking (which they mostly picked up from Kyuu).
